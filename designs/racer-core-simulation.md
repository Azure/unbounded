# Racer core simulation

Status: in progress.

## Summary

`racer-sim` is a single-process, single-thread discrete-event simulator. It runs the real Racer
decision logic (read path, peer routing, placement, caches, control plane) for up to 50,000 nodes.
To make that possible, the decision logic moves into a sans-IO crate, `racer-core`, that the
production dataplane and the simulator both call.

## Goals

- Run the same decision code as production, not a model of it.
- 50,000 nodes, 2 workers per node, one thread, at most 32 GiB RSS.
- Deterministic: the same scenario, node count, and seed give the same trace hash.
- Report latency, origin load, peer traffic, cache behavior, control-plane load, and memory.
- A small smoke scenario runs in `cargo test`. Large runs use `make racer-sim ARGS=...`.

## Non-goals

- Simulating payload bytes, crypto output, or real disk contents.
- Replacing the existing deterministic tests (`src/app/tests/dst.rs`) or `src/contention.rs`.
  `src/contention.rs` stays until `racer-sim` covers its scenarios.
- Changing production behavior. New generic code must have monomorphized defaults that compile to
  the current code.

## Architecture

### racer-core

Path: `cmd/racer-dataplane/core`, crate `racer-core` (lib `racer_core`).

- Depends only on `topology`, `racer-object-wire`, `racer-control-wire`, and `flow-control`.
- No I/O, no clocks, no threads, no OS randomness. Time is passed in as `now: Instant` plus
  `wall_ms: u64` (`racer_core::time::Now`). Randomness is an explicit RNG
  (`racer_core::time::SplitMix64`).
- Enforced two ways:
  - `core/clippy.toml` lists `disallowed-methods`.
  - `core/tests/purity.rs` scans `core/src/**/*.rs` and fails on `Instant::now`,
    `SystemTime::now`, `uring_runtime`, `environment::now`, `getrandom`, and `thread::spawn`.
- Code moves into `racer-core` and is re-exported from its old path, so callers do not change.

Pieces planned to move (phase 3): `AcquisitionBudget`, `visit_order` and `replica_score`,
`classify`, `OriginAuthority` validation, `origin_miss_error`, `recoverable`, `peer_error`,
`inherited_budget`, `optional_headroom`, retention and persist policy, and `WorkerMap::select`
(`src/read/dispatch.rs:1282`). Later phases add state machines: `CandidateWalk`, `PageFlights`,
`FillPlan`, `ServePolicy`, `MetadataCohort`, `decide_hop`, sans-IO subscriptions, and control-plane
step functions.

### Phantom caches

A phantom cache makes the same decisions as the real cache, but stores no payload. Each one sits
behind a trait with the real type as the default parameter.

1. Placement (`topology/src/placement.rs`): `Placement<R: Rankings = Scored>`. A phantom entry is a
   cursor and a referenced bit. Rankings come from a shared memo keyed by (membership identity,
   slot) that runs the real `Ranking::updated`. CLOCK hand, pinning, and `Overloaded` behavior must
   match exactly.
2. Disk segments: the simulator implements `SegmentEntries` (`alloc/src/segments.rs:692`) with a
   phantom index. Retention scoring (`src/store/catalog.rs:1358-1370`) moves to `racer-core` and
   takes `now`.
3. Memory LRU (`src/memory.rs:1106-1200`, `Entries` and `CiphertextEntries`) becomes generic over
   the value type.
4. Route cache (`topology/src/paths.rs`): per-node LRU of keys only, plus a shared route memo.

Each phantom has equivalence tests (real and phantom give identical decisions on seeded workloads
with churn) and size tests.

### racer-sim

Path: `cmd/racer-dataplane/sim`, crate `racer-sim`, binary `racer-sim`.

- Time is `u64` nanoseconds. Events sit in a `BinaryHeap` ordered by `(time, seq)`.
- Each role gets its own `SplitMix64` stream derived from the seed.
- Each node has: core state machines, phantom caches, real `flow_control` quotas (with interned
  `CacheId`), link health, 2 workers picked by `WorkerMap::select`, a CPU FIFO per worker, and a
  crypto helper.
- Network: per-node send and receive FIFOs in 1 MiB chunks, cut-through relay per chunk, and an
  RTT matrix per site pair.
- Disk: read and write FIFOs.
- Origin: per-cache concurrency cap, bandwidth FIFO, latency, and injected 412, 403, and 5xx.
- CPU costs are configurable: AEAD per byte, sign and verify per hop, ranking per chunk, path
  expansion per node, control handshakes.
- Workloads: Poisson, Zipf, cold-start storms, range reads, churn.
- Faults: partitions, crash and restart (disk survives), slow nodes, origin errors.

The JSON report has log-bucket latency histograms, origin requests and bytes per page, peer bytes,
hop counts, flight joins, rejections per `ResourceClass`, cache hits and evictions, control-plane
lag, 429s and API calls, peak memory per component, and the trace hash.

## Memory budget

32 GiB / 50,000 nodes = 687,194 bytes, about 671 KiB per node. The target is 640 KiB per node
(about 31.3 GiB total), leaving about 1.5 GiB for shared state: ranking and route memos, the event
heap, the RTT matrix, and the report.

Per-node state must therefore avoid payloads and per-node copies of anything that can be shared.
Rough budget per node:

| Component | Budget |
| --- | --- |
| Placement phantom entries | 128 KiB |
| Segment phantom index | 128 KiB |
| Memory LRU keys | 128 KiB |
| Route key cache | 64 KiB |
| Flow quotas, link health, 2 workers | 64 KiB |
| Flights, walks, control state, queues | 128 KiB |

The simulator reports peak RSS and the size of each component so this table can be checked.

## Determinism and replay

- All time comes from the event clock. All randomness comes from seeded `SplitMix64` streams.
- Hash maps in shared code use seeded hashers in simulation (phase 1: `SecondSight` in
  `alloc/src/retention.rs` and the flight table in `src/read/flight.rs:126`).
- Each processed event feeds a running trace hash. Two runs with the same inputs must give the same
  hash. A test checks this for the smoke scenario.

## Invariants

Checked during every run:

- Budgets never grow when passed along.
- Only ranked owners fetch from origin.
- Routes use at most 8 links.
- Membership versions only go up.
- At most one primary per term.

If the simulator finds a real bug, the invariant is weakened with a comment that gives the root
cause (`file:line`, scenario, seed), and an entry is added to Known issues.

## Phases

1. This document. Phase 0 read path: explicit `now` and wall time (`RequestScope::check` variant,
   budgets, retention); adaptive clock object instead of `fn()`; seeded hashers.
2. Phase 0 control plane: `now_micro` takes wall time; `new_key` takes an RNG; jitter and claim
   delay take an RNG.
3. Move pure pieces into `racer-core`. One typed `RouteBudget` rule for app and wire; tighten the
   wire to 8 links with boundary tests.
4. `Placement<R: Rankings>`, phantom, and equivalence tests.
5. Segment CLOCK and retention scoring, generic memory LRU, route key cache.
6. `racer-sim` skeleton: event loop, FIFO network, disk, origin, CPU, cache-only scenarios, CI smoke,
   make target.
7. `CandidateWalk` state machine from `resolve_epoch_traced` and `request_traced`, including the
   post-412 walk and hedging. The production async walk drives it; probe sequences must match on the
   existing scripted requester tests.
8. Payload-generic `PeerResponse`, payload-free `classify`, `PageFlights`, `FillPlan`, `ServePolicy`.
9. `MetadataCohort`, range stream scheduling, read-path scenarios.
10. `decide_hop`, typed response-validity rules, error tables.
11. Sans-IO subscriptions, link health and adaptive peers with explicit `now`, peer scenarios.
12. Control-plane step functions: lottery, seat renew and release, follower, contend, primary plan
    pass, seat server admission.
13. Plain-value fake API server, simulated host for `controlplane::Sync`, `Signal::notify` cost
    model, fix the `limits.rs` sizing comment.
14. Full-scale scenarios and the 50k / 32 GiB acceptance run. Results go in this document.

## Doc and code disagreements

Verified against the code at the start of this work.

1. `cluster-control/src/authority/election.rs:1` says "Pure: callers pass observations and clocks",
   but `now_micro` at `election.rs:124-130` calls `std::time::SystemTime::now()`. Phase 2 fixes the
   code.
2. Hop limit, 8 vs 9. The app rejects a budget when `visited + remaining_links > FAILURE_LINKS`
   (`src/topology.rs:543-544`, `FAILURE_LINKS = 8` at `src/topology.rs:507`). The wire allows
   `visited + links <= MAX_HOPS + 1`, which is 9 (`peer-wire/src/forwarding.rs:53`,
   `MAX_HOPS = 8` at `peer-wire/src/lib.rs:505`). Phase 3 tightens the wire to 8.
3. `cluster-control/src/limits.rs:44-51` sizes `MAX_CONTROL_CONNECTIONS` from snapshot and keyring
   long polls only. It does not count seat write slots or the cost of waking waiters:
   `Signal::changed` scans all registered wakers on each registration
   (`cluster-control/src/exec.rs:355-361`), so W waiters cost O(W^2), and `Signal::notify`
   (`exec.rs:340-345`) wakes all of them. Phase 13 models this and fixes the comment.
4. `controlplane/src/feed.rs:860` spawns a thread for preparation, which a single-thread simulator
   cannot use. Phase 13 adds an inline path.
5. `cluster-control/src/authority/keyring.rs:351-357`: `new_key` reads OS randomness directly.
   Not a doc conflict, but it blocks determinism. Phase 2 fixes it.
